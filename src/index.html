        At Heroku, we put one in early in an ad-hoc way without really understanding the ramifications of doing so. It
        wasn’t used for anything for the longest time, but in the meantime caused its fair share of operational pain. I
        distinctly remember Xmas 2014 where I spent a good number of my nights looking into why Postgres DELETE queries
        trying to evict old events were timing out, and leading to other knock on problems like an unstable job queue.
        Postgres isn’t particularly good at making large changes on large tables, and this was compounded by the DELETE
        operation being unbounded.

        Back around then it was about 1 TB in size. Not exactly web scale, but 10x the size of the rest of the database
        combined, and all data that no one ever looked at or used.
